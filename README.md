# HTML and CSS Practice

## Week 2

### Goals

* The idea was to replicate the HTML structure and the CSS style of this webpage:

* The 2nd task was to apply the new css style to last week's HTML.

### Comments

* Missing one important thing: making the page adaptive to different screen sizes.
* If I have to be honest, the style of the page I choose is not the most attractive, and I left some HTML parts incomplete. However, being this my first .CSS attempt ever, I would say I´m satisfied with the result and I learned a lot.
